# Landing Page Migration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how the original HTML/CSS/JS files from `/prev` have been migrated to a complete Shopify theme structure while preserving all visual and functional parity.

## File Structure Mapping

### Original Structure â†’ Shopify Structure

| Original File | Shopify Location | Purpose |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| `prev/assets/css/style.css` | `assets/lp.css` | Landing page styles (BEM-scoped) |
| `prev/assets/js/script.js` | `assets/lp.js` | Section Rendering API compatible JS |
| `earplugs-lp.html` | `templates/page.landing.json` + sections | Page template with sections |
| Header HTML | `snippets/lp-header.liquid` | Reusable header component |
| Individual sections | `sections/lp-*.liquid` | Modular sections with schema |
